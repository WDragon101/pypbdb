default version is 1.2

eighteen classes are children of class pbdb()

each class have servial method, same as PBDB API.

every method accept iformat and **kwargs

the main idea of pbdb() is compile correct URL.

URL is compared by self.base_url, self_version, self.method, self.format, **kwargs.
I use make_fp() to combined self.base_url, self_version, self.method, self.format by /
I use make_kw(**kwargs) to combined every key, value of **kwargs by &

Default result_of_url() will save the result of GET URL to a self.format file.
